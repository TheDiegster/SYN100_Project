                        Throughout the game, you will carry around a field book which records all the different things you learn. This field book will be your best friend for referencing information pertaining to the people, events, seeds, and foods that you experience in your journey. The book is organized so that there are different sections you can refer to for different aspects, such as a plants section which lists all the different plants you've found so far and details how to take care of them and other fun facts you learn about them. There is also a friends section that shows all the people you've met and the things you learn about them. <br><br>
                        You will find that earlier on in the game, a lot of the information in your fieldbook will be blank. Explore the areas around you and interact with the people you meet more to unlock these details complete your fieldbook!

                        them a text box will appear on the bottom of the screen where they will talk about themselves and the the seed they carry. You'll find several NPCs scattered across the city; hiding in buildings and markets. Relevant
                        information of the conversation will be automatically recorded in your field book!
