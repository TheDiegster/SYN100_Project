                    The game begins with you, the main character, explaining how you’d like to see more greenery and help others grow more greenery after the world experienced devastating natural disasters that hindered lots of vegetation growth. After a bittersweet event, you gather the people you’ve met to begin your adventure to restore the vegetation and find, grow, and collect seeds of life.

            <h3>Regions</h3>
            <p style = "font-size: 21px; line-height: 34px;">
                Throughout the game, you’ll explore a region affected by various disasters on your quest to expand the greenery and restore the natural environments that once decorated the landscape. There are various areas within this region you can travel to which can help you understand the kind of plant life that used to live there and how they have been affected by climate change. In these areas, you can also learn how to take care of the local plants and grow them in your garden.

                            Covered in smog, the city is an area ripe with pollution and completely devoid of natural life. However, it serves as the refuge many people have fled to in the aftermath of the disasters and subsequent destruction of their homelands, becoming a bastion against the worsening climate. The city is where you will meet the vast majority of your companions and gather many of the supplies you’ll need to expand your garden.

                            This small village is the place you call home and where you begin your adventure. It is one of few settlements in this region other than the city where people live, being lucky enough to not suffer the same disasters many others have faced. Unlike the city, the village is quiet and cozy and evokes a feeling of welcomeness and the people living there are a tight knit community determined not to let their homes succumb to the elements.

                            The barren land is a place which is described as having nothing there: no settlements, no wildlife, nothing but flat ground stretching out for miles. To many people, it is nothing more than a depressing wasteland. However, to a select few, it is the perfect place for opportunity as surprisingly, the soil there is fertile. The barren land serves as the main place where you grow your garden, slowly transforming it into a lush, enriched environment.

                            The forest is a vast region which connects many of the other areas you can travel to. Once home to a thriving ecosystem of various plants and animals, it is now nothing more than a withered husk of what it once was. Much of the forest was burnt by wildfires and what remained gradually died off over time. The trees still standing are dried and hollow, and the plants and animals still clinging onto life are far and few between.

They always spoke fondly of their former home and though Carter wanted to travel there, she never had time. They also said that lots of wild garlic grew there, so Carter decided to try growing some herself. However, she hasn’t done anything yet due to being busy.

Her family members lost their jobs when the fields could no longer produce fruit– the vines too shriveled to grow anything. She always hated eating grape seeds, so she held onto some from the last few bunches that her family members picked.
