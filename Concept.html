            <p>This page is to describe + show art of the different conceptual elements of the game in detail and the purpose they all serve. For example, the different locations and what specific stuff is there that is notable (for example, the city could have a plaza to get tools or whatever and cafe where the mc could meet with some npcs). This would also be the place to go in detail with the different characters, such as their personality, background, and other stuff. We could also use this page to describe how this project ties into climate change and representation and whatever else we were supposed to put in it. To be honest, if all this stuff is going in the storyboard, this page isn't needed. It's just there as a placeholder for now.</p>
